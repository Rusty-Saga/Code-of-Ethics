# Rusty Saga Code of Ethics

## Introduction

Welcome to Rusty Saga's Code of Ethics! I'm all about creating awesome games and having fun, but I also believe in doing things the right way. This document is here to let you know the principles I follow when making my games.

## 1. Integrity and Honesty

- My Ethics history will be available on GitHub publicly to allow people to see any changes that I make.
- I promise to always be straight with my players. No sneaky stuff, no hidden agendas, just honest games and honest communication.

## 2. Respect for Privacy

- I'll only collect what I need to run my games.

## 3. Fair Play and Transparency

- I believe in fair play. I'll always be clear about how things work. No tricks, no scams.

## 4. Content Guidelines

- My games might include content that's edgy, controversial, or even offensive to some. I believe in creative freedom, so my games may explore all kinds of themes and ideas, but I will warn of anything like this within this repository.

## 5. Commitment to Quality

- I aim to make my games fun, engaging, and as bug-free as possible. I'll keep improving and updating my games to make sure you're having the best time I can provide.

## 6. Industry Practices

- I understand some people's concerns with AI-generated content. However, as there is currently only one developer and no other people working on these games, Rusty Saga currently uses AI-generated content for art and other items. I may change this in the future if I can, but I'll let you know.

## Conclusion

Thanks for taking the time to read my Code of Ethics. I'm excited to have you with me on this journey and I can't wait to show you what Iâ€™m working on. Game on!
